# PySMforSTRIP


This repository includes scripts to produce input sky maps for the LSPE/STRIP simulation pipeline. 

The tool used to produce the maps is [PySM](https://github.com/bthorne93/PySM_public).

The following programs have been implemented so far:

1. `PySMmap_production` uses PySM to produce the T, Q, U maps of the polarized sky (cmb, synchrotron, dust) and rotate the map from Galactic to Equatorial coordinates
